1. download Advanced Wars Repo and open it
2. Open up Advanced Wars folder
4. open the file that says "Advanced Wars.Jar"

How to play:
  it's complicated 
  
Note:
  The Advanced Wars.Jar has a bug that won't let you play 'Player Vs. Player'. I don't know that this is, But it works if you open the game through eclipse
  Don't try to open the game through eclipse if you don't know how. It's complicated and might blow up your system (not really)
  Any questions please contact your local Asian, they might know.
